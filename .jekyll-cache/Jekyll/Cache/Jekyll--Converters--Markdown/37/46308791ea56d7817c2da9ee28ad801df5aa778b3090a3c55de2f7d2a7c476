I"·<h3 id="hello-reader">Hello Reader!</h3>
<p>I usually go by Bikram. Currently, I work at Raytheon Technologies and am a part of its Global Engineering Leadership Development program. I graduated from the Indian Institute of Science(IISc) Bangalore with a BS &amp; MS in Material Sciences in 2020.</p>

<p>Like me, my interests tend to change(or mature) over time. 
Itâ€™s too early for me to have concentrated academic interests,
but I do enjoy problems that needs little math, some looking over stack-exchange and some lecture notes of unknown professors (thank you, internet!).
I do also enjoy reading non-quantitative fields like science policy, public policy &amp; science communication</p>

<p>Other than academic and professional stuff, I enjoy spending time doing a variety of things like making this website. 
I enjoy cycling (cycled from Germany to France!), running and in general promoting good nutrition. 
I also enjoy travelling (have been to 11 countries!) and hope to hit my 100 country goal before I hit 40. 
My friends tell me I cook well too (or maybe they just enjoy free food)</p>

<p>Lastly, I canâ€™t deny a cup of good masala chai(no sugar!) and some â€˜charchaâ€™ to go with it.</p>

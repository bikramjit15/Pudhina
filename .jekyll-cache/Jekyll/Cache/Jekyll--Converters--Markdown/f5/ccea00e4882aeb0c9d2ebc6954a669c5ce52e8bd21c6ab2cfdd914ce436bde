I"®<h3 id="hello-reader">Hello Reader!</h3>
<p>I usually go by Bikram. Currently, I work at Raytheon Technologies and am a part of its
Global Engineering Leadership Development program.
I graduated from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore with a BS &amp; MS in Material Sciences in 2020.</p>

<p>Like me, my interests change (or mature). 
While itâ€™s too early for me to have concentrated academic or professional interests, 
but I enjoy problems that require a little math, 
some looking over stack-exchange and some lecture notes from unknown professors 
(thank you, internet!). I do also enjoy reading non-quantitative fields like science 
policy, public policy &amp; science communication.</p>

<p>Other than academic and professional things, 
I enjoy doing a variety of things like making this website. I enjoy cycling (cycled from Germany to France!), running, and promoting good nutrition. I also love traveling (have been to 11 countries!) and hope to hit my 100 country goal before I hit 40. My friends tell me I cook well too (or maybe they just enjoy free food)</p>

<p>Lastly, I canâ€™t deny a cup of perfect masala chai(no sugar!) 
and some â€˜charchaâ€™ to go with it.</p>
